# Log week # 2 (12/03/18 - 09/03/18)
## Front-end Developement

### Monday
* Looking into more frameworks. Asked colleagues opinions. Found these two light weight, fast, react-like frameworks:
    * Preact
    * Infernojs

* Installed and tried both of light weighted alternatives, considering to use them for smaller projects in the future

### Tuesday
* I have done a step to achieve greater developer experience - installed a new code editor - visual studio code. Special features that help me as a developer:
    * Built in terminal
    * Built in debugger
    * Built in source control (git)
    * Big community
    * More extensions

* To train my API's knowledge I am doing some Lynda tutorials. I want to have a reusable react component that will fetch (es6) API's in simple, short, corret way.
    * I used 'Postman', 'newsapi.org', default react

### Wednesday
I have spent a day learning about SDK's, including google sdk, facebook sdk
* I considered it as preparation for my tasks

### Thursday
* Reading documentation at [owasp](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page) website. To learn more about security, attacks, potential website threats. Also [google security docs](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/learning/xss/).
    * Cross-site scripting attacks
    * Injections, leaks

* Also looking at tokens, and JSON web tokens (jwt) (security)

### Friday
Playing with security
* Tokens, firebase tokens

* Coding Angular component to help a colleague

Tried to look at some JS based server side
* Express with node js
